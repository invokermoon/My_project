Comiple:
		option 1:make
		option 2:./build -c
Clean:
		option 1:make clean
		option 2:./build -C

Insmod and Run:
		 su root
		./build.sh -i
Rmmod:
		./build -r


Note:
		Actually, i should do better,but time is limit. and i have a lot of jobs to do.Please forgiveness.
		And for testing more quick and more easy to understand, i write a test and merge it into the module.
		So you just press:
				./build -i
		1.It will auto
				./insmod **.ko funcs=sys_clone,sys_read
		and sys_clone,sys_read is easy to capture,also you can insmod sys_XXX by yourself or modify the shell script.
		2.It also will print the memleak infos, and these infos , you can refer to" vmalloc_test1" and "vmalloc_test2" in the qeexo.c
		3.If you want to input your own "scan_start_addr" and "scan_end_addr", i suggest that you should keep the interval between "scan_start_addr" and 
		"scan_end_addr" is much small. This operation is too wasting time.

Algos of qeexo:
		1.kprobe
		2.kretprobe
		3.list_head
		4.rbtree
		5.cpu_clock,high solution timer

Also, maybe there are some bugs that need more test to fix it.
